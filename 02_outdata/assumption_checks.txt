	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  res
W = 0.97122, p-value = 3.455e-06


Levene-like check via SD by group (rule-of-thumb):
# A tibble: 6 Ã— 4
  species   sex       sd     n
  <fct>     <fct>  <dbl> <int>
1 Adelie    female  2.03    73
2 Adelie    male    2.28    73
3 Chinstrap female  3.11    34
4 Chinstrap male    1.56    34
5 Gentoo    female  2.05    58
6 Gentoo    male    2.72    61

If assumptions look violated, report and add a robustness note (e.g., Welch ANOVA within species).
