  abstract = {Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica, asking whether environmental variability in the form of winter sea ice is associated with differences in male and female pre-breeding foraging niche. Each season, study nests, where pairs of adults were present, were individually marked and chosen before the onset of egg-laying, and consistently monitored. When study nests were found at the one-egg stage, both adults were captured to obtain blood samples used for molecular sexing and stable isotope analyses, and measurements of structural size and body mass. At the time of capture, each adult penguin was quickly blood sampled ({\textasciitilde}1 ml) from the brachial vein. After handling, individuals at study nests were further monitored to ensure the pair reached clutch completion, i.e., two eggs. Molecular analyses were conducted at Simon Fraser University following standard PCR protocols, and stable isotope analyses were conducted at the Stable Isotope Facility at the University of California, Davis using an elemental analyzer interfaced with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer},
